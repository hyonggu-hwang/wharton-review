title: Day 4 - Overidentification Test
---

### Goals
The goals for this day are to finish coding up the SMM estimator, run it, and also perform the test of overidentifying restrictions and counterfactual analyses. The deliverables are:

- SMM estimator
- Compute your final parameter estimates and their standard errors. Do they make sense?
- How well does the model fit the data? Compare the simulated and empirical moments. 
- Does the model fail the test of overidnentifying restrictions?
- What would be an interesting counterfactual experiment to run? How would you do it?

### Standard Errors

### Overidentification Test

### Model Fit

### Counterfactuals
